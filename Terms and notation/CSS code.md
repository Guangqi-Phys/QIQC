A [[Stabilizer code]] is a CSS code if its stabiliser group can be generated by the disjoint union of a set of $X$-operators and a set of $Z$-operators. In this case, its parity check is a block matrix:
$$H=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
0 & H_X \\
H_Z & 0
\end{array}\right)$$
where $H_X$ has size $m_x \times n$ and $H_Z$ has size $m_z \times n$ if the generating set of $X$-stabilisers $/ Z$-stabilisers has cardinality $m_x / m_z$.

It is handy to describe CSS codes in terms of [[Chain complex]]es. A length $\ell$ chain complex is a collection of vector spaces $C^0, \ldots, C^{\ell}$ and linear maps $\delta_i: C^i \rightarrow C^{i+1}$ with the only constraint
$$\delta_{i+1} \delta_i=0$$
for $i=0, \ldots, \ell-1$. If $H_X$ and $H_Z$ are $m_x \times n$ and $m_z \times n$ binary matrices, then the chain complex:
$$\mathbb{F}_2^{m_z} \xrightarrow{H_Z^T} \mathbb{F}_2^n \xrightarrow{H_X} \mathbb{F}_2^{m_x}$$

is well defined. 

In fact, the commutative condition on the stabilisers of the code entails that the $X$-generators and the $Z$-generators of the code have even overlap, such that they are orthogonal when seen as binary vectors. 

In other words, $H_X \cdot H_Z^T=0$ is equivalent to the defining property of chain complexes. In general, we can associate a CSS code to any chain complex $\left\{C^i, \delta_i\right\}$ of length at least 3 by equating $H_Z^T=\delta_i$ and $H_X=\delta_{i+1}$ for some index $i$. 

In the chain complex language, we say that the code has length $\operatorname{dim} C_{i+1}$ and the dimension of the $(i+1)$-th homology group $\mathcal{H}_{i+1}=\operatorname{ker} \delta_{i+1} / \operatorname{Im} \delta_i$. Equivalently, the dimension of the code is the dimension of the $(i+1)$-th cohomology group $\mathcal{H}_{i+1}^*=\operatorname{ker} \delta_i^T / \operatorname{Im} \delta_{i+1}^T$. The $X$ and $Z$ distances are given respectively by the minimum weight of any non-zero vector in $\mathcal{H}_{i+1}^*$ and $\mathcal{H}_{i+1}$.
