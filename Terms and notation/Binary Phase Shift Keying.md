In Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation, the binary data is typically mapped as follows:

- A binary '0' is mapped to a phase of 0 degrees (or equivalently, to +1).
- A binary '1' is mapped to a phase of 180 degrees (or equivalently, to -1).

This modulation scheme is used because it makes it easy to differentiate between the two binary states based on their phase difference (180 degrees apart), which is also represented as opposite signs in amplitude (+1 and -1).
