Quantum LDPC (Low-Density Parity-Check) codes are an important class of quantum error correction codes that have garnered significant interest for their potential to improve the fault tolerance of quantum computers. 

The goal of developing quantum LDPC codes is to achieve desirable code properties. Specifically, the objective is to obtain $[n, O(n), O(n)]$ quantum codes, which feature constant overhead and constant distance. We call it [[Good quantum LDPC codes]].

Quantum LDPC codes are defined by sparse parity-check matrices, meaning each row and column of the matrix contains only a few non-zero entries. This sparsity is what gives LDPC codes their name and their decoding efficiency.

1. Sparse Parity-Check Matrix: In classical LDPC codes, a sparse matrix is used to check the parity conditions of a binary string. If the dot product of this matrix with the string (considered as a vector) equals zero, then there are no errors detected by the code. Quantum LDPC codes extend this idea to the quantum setting. They use two sparse matrices, often denoted as $H_X$ and $H_Z$, corresponding to the two types of quantum errors (bit-flip and phase-flip).
2. [[Stabilizer code|Stabilizer Formalism]]: Quantum LDPC codes are a subset of stabilizer codes, which use a group of operators (stabilizers) generated by the rows of the $H_X$ and $H_Z$ matrices. These stabilizers commute with each other and stabilize the quantum state of the logical qubits, ensuring that the state is preserved against errors.
