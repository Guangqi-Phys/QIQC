In the paper [[Quintavalle-2020-Single-shot]], the authors demonstrate the [[Confinement ]]condition of [[3D product codes]] in Theorem 3 as follows:

> [!theorem] Theorem 3. 
> All $3 D$ product codes have $(t, f) X$-confinement where $t$ is equal to the $Z$-distance of the code and $f(x)=$ $x^3 / 2$ or better.

In this notes, we follow the paper to give a detailed proof for this theorem.
