[[Hypergraph product codes]] were developed to combine any two classical linear codes into a quantum code. This approach enables the application of classical coding theory's extensive insights to quantum coding.

The higher-dimensional hypergraph product is an extension of the quantum hypergraph product to higher dimensions, where the structure being considered isn't just based on two classical codes, but rather on a more complex, multi-dimensional set of relations. 

By using higher-dimensional structures, one can improve the code distance and the code rate compared to lower-dimensional quantum codes. The larger the dimensionality of the hypergraph, the more complex the code, which generally leads to better error-correction capabilities. Due to their complex structure, higher-dimensional codes tend to be more [[Fault tolerant]], offering better protection against errors.
