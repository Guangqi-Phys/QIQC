For noiseless parity checks, the 4D toric code has been conjectured to have the same maximal threshold of 10.9% as the 2D toric code. One can map the 4D toric code to a statistical physics model called the 4D random plaquette gauge model which they argue to have the same phase diagram as the 2D random bond Ising model.
